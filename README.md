### Installation

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'htmlkickstart'
```

then run `bundle` in the console, and then run:

    rails g htmlkickstart:install

command. This should add:

```ruby
 *= require kickstart
 *= require kickstart-buttons
 *= require kickstart-grid
 *= require kickstart-menus
 *= require zellner
 *= require jquery.fancybox-1.3.4
 *= require extra
 *= require rails-kickstart
```

into `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`.

This is maximum install, experiment, and feel free to remove, for example, `extra` from required styles, if you need to roll your own.
`jquery.fancybox` could be removed, if you use something elese for lightboxes.
`rails-kickstart` contains Rails-related styles.

This way, you have to put into `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` something like:

```ruby
<div id="wrap" class="clearfix">
  <div class="col_12">
    <%= yield %>
  </div>
</div>
```

Also,

```ruby
//= require kickstart
//= require jquery.snippet.min
```

will be injected into `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`

`jquery.snippet.min` is for syntaxis highlighting.

As always, have fun when you code, and don't fordet to call your parents, from time to time!
